# emulator-8080
A simple emulator for the Intel 8080 microprocessor written in C, based on the fantastic emulator101.com tutorial.

## Disassembler
disassembler.c contains source code for a very basic disassembler, which takes a binary file as an input and prints it out as valid 8080 assembly code.

## Emulator
emulator.c contains the source code for the emulator itself. It's very early and probably filled with bugs at the moment.
